Description of three observable trends based on the data

Lat vs Cloudiness
On average, cloudiness is highest around 60 to 80 deg latitiude but there is very little cloud cover in the southern hemisphere towards the south pole.

Lat vs Humidity 
Based on the plot , the air in the most "arid" desert regions of the planet (30 degrees N or S latitude) contains more water vapor than temperate regions much farther north, and certainly more than the polar regions.

Lat vs Temp
There is a direct relationship between the latitue and the temprature. The further away from the equator that you are the less sunlight that this location receives. 

Lat Vs Wind speed.
From the data collected there isn't a significant variation of wind speed based on latitudue. However the latitdue has an impact on the wind direction and magnitude, depending on if it is the nothern or souther hemisphere.
